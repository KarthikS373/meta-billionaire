When it comes to community-focused NFT projects which provide a heavy focus on quality and adaptability with the Metaverse, look no further than [CloneX](https://clonex.rtfkt.com) - an NFT collection of avatars called Clones created by the digitized sneaker manufacturer [RTFKT](https://rtfkt.com) and Japanese artist **Takashi Murakami**.

Why this particular project is interesting is the ecosystem in which they want their users to be a part - being immersed in the Metaverse to allow real-life stimulation eg being able to dress their avatars in high-end fashions and personalize them however they see fit. The collection comes with different styles, haircuts, and accessories for all avatars which gives a high amount of opportunities for customization. 

This project is unique in the way they have incorporated technology such as augmented reality and in-game engines to complement the NFTs and Blockchain authentication and they have been able to create one-of-a-kind sneakers and rare collectibles. From sneakers, the project evolved to creating a line of fashion pieces specific to Metaverse and then to initiatives where the NFTs can be used to get physical sneakers and other items. 

CloneX combines many aspects of the virtual world and puts the power in the creator's hands to curate the experience as they see fit. The ecosystem that they have created is widely known to be one of the most immersive in the Web3 space and a portal for fans of fashion to be part of a new world and adventure. 

When you understand what CloneX is all about, it makes no surprise to hear that Nike entered into an acquisition of **RTFKT Studios** to launch branded NFT collectibles. The corporation (like many others) has seen the opportunities for next generation marketing via the Metaverse and identified CloneX as a means of breaking into this space. 

John Donahoe, Nike president, and CEO said the following about the merger:

“This acquisition is another step that accelerates Nike’s digital transformation and allows us to serve athletes and creators at the intersection of sport, creativity, gaming, and culture,” 

The news of the partnership caused a spike in the price of CloneX when reports came out near the end of 2021. Undoubtedly due to the significance of such a merger being the first acquisition of an NFT company by a huge corporation.

Since the merger was announced, under the **Nike** umbrella, CloneX has been able to develop its universe further and offer more exciting collections to its users such as an official virtual and physical apparel collection which RTFKT Studios has teased to be coming soon.

CloneX has shown itself to be one of the more innovative projects in Web3 with a defined niche carved out in the fashion space. Working with **Nike** only furthers cements the potential of what RTFKT Studios has to offer in terms of **merging the virtual and physical fashion** world together and showcasing what the future has to offer in terms of immersive experiences which is growing to be a cornerstone of what the Metaverse has to offer the masses.
