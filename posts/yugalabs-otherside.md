[Yuga Labs](https://yuga.com) have proven to be a major player when it comes to the NFT space. The success of [Bored Ape Yacht](https://boredapeyachtclub.com/#/) will go down in history and this project will forever be synonymous when people talk about NFTs in the mainstream. The YugaLabs organization has become a household name as a result of this success also.

What **YugaLabs** implemented in terms of strategy was innovative and industry defining. A community-led project which built an ecosystem that is as dynamic as much as it is sustainable. 

Bored Ape Yacht Club is a collection of 10,000 ape themed NFTs with different artworks, rarities, and traits. What YugaLabs included with this project were the real life benefits which made the project enticing for anyone looking to invest - the opportunity to become a part of an exclusive club when you owned a **BAYC NFT** and with the membership, getting the perks that come with it and also the commercial usage rights over your ape.

Since the brand launched in April 2021, the price has soared ever since.

**YugaLabs** have proven to be innovators in the Web3 space and as a forward-thinking organization, people always wanted to know what was next to come from them.

That answer can be answered in one word - [Otherside](https://otherside.xyz).

Otherside is a gaming metaverse in which users can turn their NFTs into playable characters. What was very interesting about this project was that users could purchase ‘Otherdeeds’, which are tokenized land deeds that allow them to purchase space in Otherside.

During the mint, the Otherdeeds sold for 305 Apecoins per plot, and buyers could only buy 2 plots per crypto wallet. The Ethereum network even crashed during the mint as the creators brought in $300 million from their launch event and a further $300 million from resales on Opensea. 

Why Otherside is such a significant initiative is because it is truly an example of how engaged a community that YugaLabs have cultivated that they were able to create such a massive buzz for their project. What they have done is a masterclass in how to build a brand, maintain and grow its success and then use the brand to leverage into other areas. This is something that many marketers can learn from in all industries, not just the NFT space.

For NFTs, Otherside is something to be championed because ultimately, the market will only be as strong as the top players and YugaLabs is a top player. As they push the limits as to what an NFT project is able to create in terms of opportunities, the more that NFT projects to follow will be able to achieve, through following YugaLabs blueprint, or using the examples that they have set to create new and even more innovative frameworks. 

Despite the issues and backlash that YugaLabs faced from Otherside in terms of **high gas fees, the Ethereum crash**, and potential phishing scams, what they are doing with this project is still widely seen as trailblazing and although a community is divided from it, in the long run, what they are doing will, in the end, be seen as a huge positive for NFTs and for the future of the Web3 space.

YugaLabs as of now is valued at over **$4 billion** and much of that is due to the risk they have taken. As an NFT studio, they have defied the naysayers and their contributions to Web3 is providing to be ever more significant by the day.
