Data has highlighted a decrease in NFT sales of 92% compared to around this time last year and on the cryptocurrency side of things, Terra Luna completely crashed after all-time highs in April, thus losing $40 billion of value in a very short period. When you look at examples like these in a nutshell, it’s easy to see the future as bleak for cryptocurrency and NFTs. However, there are many reasons that point to the future being bright - reasons that will be explored below.

# So Why Is Everything Down ?

Before we speculate on the future of NFTs and crypto, it’s important that we look at how we got to this point where the market has shown signs of decline:

One of the main reasons for the decline in the NFT space specifically when it comes to the volume of sales across the board is investor reluctance. The data shows that in 2022, there was a transaction volume decrease of **47%** in Q1 of this year compared to the previous quarter. What we can gather from this is that reality is finally hitting the NFT market when it comes to investment and many are coming to the realization that many NFTs are simply overhyped and low on utility, thus making them unworthy investments.

Relating to the crypto crash, there is no one simple answer that can explain the decline, as a handful of factors contributed to the situation: including rising inflation, instability caused by the Ukraine war, and increases in interest rates. The crash of [TerraUSD](https://www.terra.money) which was supposed to be a stablecoin caused a major crater in the landscape which is projected to take years to recover from.

# Is There Hope ?

Despite the reasons to be pessimistic about the future of crypto and NFTs, there are many reasons to look to the future with much optimism:

Even though the data shows massive declines in transaction volume, this doesn’t mean that all assets are doing poorly. For example, [Moonbirds](https://www.moonbirds.xyz) NFT project added $500 million worth of trading volume and the Solana blockchain saw a 91% monthly increase, recording nearly $300 million in NFT trading. [Yuga Labs' Otherdeeds](https://otherside.xyz) NFT, a virtual land sale for a forthcoming video game saw a huge amount of demand, to the point it crashed the Ethereum Blockchain.

What we can gather from this is that many of the ‘blue chip’ NFT projects are still going strong and look to only get stronger. 

The future of NFTs looks to be bright for the projects which do not rely on hype to sell them, but rather those projects who are offering something unique for users. The growing discussion is about ‘utility’ aka real-life benefits, and those projects that offer real utility will look to be seen as better investments which means lower volume for NFT projects across the board, but higher volume for those individual projects.

For cryptocurrency, despite the crashes in the market, there are still many reasons to stay the course. The fact that many corporations and companies are incorporating it into their financial strategy is an indication of its potential when it comes to business. Companies such as **Tesla** are not only holding billions in crypto assets but also discussing whether to accept **Bitcoin** for payments. Experts predict that many more companies will buy into it.

# Overall

Overall, we cannot predict the future for both cryptocurrency and NFTs, we can only look at the current patterns and trends and gauge that where there have been dips and crashes in the markets, they are merely bumps in the road for the future we are heading to which is largely Blockchain led. There are many reasons to be optimistic, although caution should always be had regarding investments as we’ve seen from the data that no asset is bulletproof.
